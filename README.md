This is a simple calculator.

This is my first JavaScript project, it is inspired by Mac's and DuckDuckGo's calculators.

It sums, substracs, multiplicates, divides and does percentages. 

So far, there's still a problem I haven't been able to solve, which is that for every new calculation it's easier to clear all in order to make a new calculation. It can compute after the first result but gives an error if you want to add a new value.
